      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>My name is Jack Krolik, and I‚Äôm a Neuroscience and Data Science student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for improving lives through technology‚Äîparticularly in the fields of brain health and medicine. My journey has been shaped by personal experience, scientific curiosity, and a drive to make an impact through data and innovation.</p>
          <p>My interest in the brain started in high school when I joined a mental health club and began reading books like <em>Grit</em> by Angela Duckworth. That early curiosity became personal during my freshman year of college, when I suffered a concussion. I used exercise to stimulate blood flow to my brain, and it helped me recover faster than expected. That experience taught me the power of the brain-body connection‚Äîand it reinforced my desire to better understand how we can support brain health through science and technology.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I developed a love for data through fitness. Tracking workouts, analyzing trends, and setting measurable goals gave me a real appreciation for how data could be used to optimize performance and drive meaningful progress. That passion grew into a broader fascination with data science and its power to improve lives, especially in healthcare. It‚Äôs why I chose to study both neuroscience and data science in college‚Äîbecause I believe the future of health lies at the intersection of the two.</p>
          <p>Currently, I volunteer at UCSF in the Neuropsychiatry Lab led by Dr. Andrew Krystal. I‚Äôm working on a clinical-grade research project that uses over 1,000 hours of intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients. I developed a deep learning pipeline‚Äîbased on CNN-LSTM architectures with multi-head attention‚Äîto classify sleep stages and identify misfiring neurons. This approach improved accuracy by over 10% compared to existing methods. We‚Äôre now preparing the work for publication and open-sourcing the code so other researchers and clinicians can benefit from it.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve also volunteered at Northeastern‚Äôs Brain ImPACT Lab, where I‚Äôve led exercise interventions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. I help facilitate EEG and MRI assessments and analyze data to explore how physical activity affects brain recovery and plasticity. It‚Äôs incredibly meaningful to work directly with patients and see the human side of neuroscience‚Äîit constantly reminds me why this work matters.</p>
          <p>In industry, I‚Äôve led impactful projects‚Äîfrom launching a web-based medical calculator at Suki AI to building a regulatory compliance chatbot at MasterControl using Neo4j, Mistral-7B, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I‚Äôve also co-authored a paper on automating medical Q&A evaluation with LLMs, reducing review time by 96%.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I‚Äôm exploring industry opportunities, especially roles that combine technical execution with leadership‚Äîlike product management or R&D-focused positions. I‚Äôm also open to pursuing a PhD in the future if the right research opportunity arises. No matter the path, I want to be at the intersection of data science, neuroscience, and innovation‚Äîbuilding tools that improve lives and empower clinicians and patients alike.</p>
